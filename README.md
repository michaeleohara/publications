documentation to reproduce my published papers

Here lies data, code, and instructions for reproducing my published work guided by the principles of the TIER Protocol (https://www.projecttier.org/) The documentation for the earlier papers was organized retroactively, and so is not optimal but should be better than most. 

Instructions for reproducing each paper are contained in the readme file for each project. Most important: keep the documentation folder structure intact and run files right where they are. File paths are relative to this structure, so if things get moved, all of the addresses will need to be changed, and that way lies madness...
